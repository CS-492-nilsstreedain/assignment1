# Assignment 1: Simple Android App in Kotlin  
## Objectives
Successfully create an Android project in Android Studio that utilizes Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, then run it successfully on an emulator.

## Tasks
- Create a customized implementation of this project in Part 3 of Unit 1 of Android Basics with Compose: Project: Create a Business Card app Links to an external site.
    - Be sure to consult the course materials for help as needed
    - Make sure that you have successfully installed Android Studio as per the instructions in Part 2 of Unit 1.
- Your app needs to display the information shown in the sample screen shot in Step 1 ("Before you begin") with the following changes:
    - Have your name (first and last, as shown in Canvas) underneath the Android logo
    - Change "Android Developer Extraordinaire" to "CS 492 Student Extraordinaire"
    - You can list anything valid (including what is used in that sample shot) for the phone and social information
    - Replace the "jen.doe@android.com" email with your OSU email
    - The text and background color can be whatever you choose, as long as they are easy to read
- When you have implemented the app with these changes, run it on an Android emulator and record your screen per the instructions below.
    - Once recorded, upload your demo video per the instructions provided (provided link highly recommended)
The app has to run without crashing.

## Notes
This is meant to be a very simple assignment.  The process that we are following here will be needed for every project.  It’s an easy way to verify that Android Studio is installed correctly and that you can successfully navigate the project creation process as well as running on an emulator.

Also, please be aware that when writing code, naming files, etc. it is crucial that everything be to specification. **Please know that any deviation from the instructions on any work in this course, however small, will lead to a deduction.**

## What to turn in
Highly recommended:  Tips and Guidance for Video Submissions (Jack Barnes)

When complete, submit a video recording of your computer screen that includes all of the following:

1. Code editor displaying a part of the app’s codebase. 
    - Have a visible comment block in the displayed code file that displays (in a clean easily readable manner):
        1. Your name
        2. OSU
        3. CS 492
2. The app already running in the emulator.

**This video for this assignment should not be longer than 10 seconds.**

## Grading criteria
Be sure to consult the rubric for expectations regarding your submission.

## Extensions
Want to do more? Try the following extra challenges.
1. If you have a device, this is a good opportunity to start experimenting with putting an app on your device as well
2. Try out some different layouts and note what changes you needed to make in your Composable functions to achieve this
3. Experiment with different colors for your text and background, including different colors for different parts of the UI
4. As you explore the next unit, look for ways to implement what you've learned there to enhance this and other apps
